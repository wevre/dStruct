[] (2018-08-01) : Generators

	I could return generators from `fetchStructsForGname`, `fetchValuesForFname`,
	and `fetchKeyedStructs` in dConnection; and `structsFromRefArray`, and
	`structsFromKeyArray` in dStruct. At call sites, mostly, these are fed into
	`foreach` loops, but in cases where not, could use PHP's `iteratorToArray` to
	convert into array.

[] (2018-07-16) : Oversize values

	Newer version of MySQL gives error when a value is too large for column.
	Older version just ignored and truncated. So we need to think about where we
	put checks in for oversize values. Could happen in dStruct when values
	are set. Or could happen in dConnection when SQL insert statement is
	executed.

	This affects `meta_keys`, `tbl_char03`, `tbl_concat`, and it cropped up in
	BYT where I was storing an array of details in tbl_concat and one was too
	long.

	Another solution is to design better objects. For example, the approach at
	BYT could be replaced with DCF's dsProperty objects.

	This happened in BYT with an array of strings. Single strings can wrap if
	longer than 90, but we didn't create a mechanism for arrays of strings to do
	that. But we could. Some marker, for example, could sit at the end of the
	string to indicate that it wraps to the next SEQ.

[X] (2018-07-09) : Composer integration

	Add a `composer.json` file and reorganize as necessary to work with Composer
	and Packagist.

[X] (2018-07-04) : Keyed shared connections

	`dsConnection::shared()` can take a key and return a connection associated
	with a key. Supplying no key uses "_default_". This solves BYT where we have
	two connections alive at the same time.

[] (2018-03-07) : Define dberror page

	Put a const in dConnection that is the script to show when we can't connect
	to the database. It's /dberror for most of our installations.

[] (2018-03-03) : Schema-less design

	I want to explore a schema-less design. So take away the `selfFieldDefs`
	method and an object just stuffs everything into the database as keyed
	fields. Maybe the list of field names is needed, but the field type is not.
	So every item in the db is a generic object with arbitrary fields.

[] (2017-11-16) : Deadlocks

	I'm not 100% certain about this, but it seems like deadlocks occur in mysql
	when locks are acquired in different orders. And locks are based on which
	tables you are opening. So it might be wise to order our
	inserts/updates/deletes when we are committing a struct based on the table.
	Maybe even just sorting the updates based on alphabetical table name would
	help? Not sure. Would also have to sort tables when fetching a struct so they
	occur in the same order. It wouldn't be too hard to implement, but I'm not
	sure if we would ever see a result until next year's MWB deluge.

	There are two places in dConnection where this comes into play. In method
	`fetchDefs` we load up the $this->tables structure, so sort it by table name.
	Secondly, in `confirmStruct` the same structure is updated, so sort it
	afterwards again by table name.

	In dStruct, the `commitStruct` logic runs by whatever fnames lives in the
	insert/update/delete queues. Sort those by table name before processing.

[] (2017-10-18) : Other databases

	There are database systems that do what I created here in dStruct. (For
	example, Amazon's DynamoDB.) Perhaps instead of worrying about improvements
	and new features, I spend time learning how those systems work, and migrating
	to them.

[] (2016-09-17) : Unrecognized fields

	The __set function could ignore any field that isn’t part of
	dStructFieldDefs. That would prevent us from trying to stuff something
	unrecognized in the database.

[] (2016-09-01) : Domain creation

	Setting up a new database does not set up new domains. Need something for
	setting up domains. Even a simple function that could be called to create a
	domain and return the integer.

[] (2016-08-31) : Meta table for deleted idees

	Create a meta table that keeps track of idee’s of deleted structs. Then when
	a new struct is created, it can recycle old idee’s.

[] (2016-08-31) : Unused fields audit

	Create an audit that checks for fields defined in the database that are no
	longer reported as fields for an object (sort of the opposite of what we are
	doing now in dConnection::confirmStruct) and remove them.

[] (2015-09-15) : Manage error messages

	Give users of the library a way to turn error messages on and off. Such as a
	flag on dStruct and dConnection that can be set by the caller.
